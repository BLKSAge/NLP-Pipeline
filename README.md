</h1>


## About
The goal of this lab is to build a Question Answer (QA) pipeline for financial documents that financial analysts can use to inform their research by processing tons of text based data quickly, and pulling out key insights.

- Note your results may be different from the solutions. Evaluate your results. 

# Steps:
1. Build an initial pipeline using a single text document financial_context.
1. Test a few pretrained models and select one to use for this task.
1. Evaluate the performance of your model.
1. Make recommendations for when if should and should not be used.
1. BONUS: Extend the pipeline to a larger set of documents from the FinQA data.

# Data
In this lab you will data from the FinQA dataset.
In the `data` folder you have a copy of the FinQA datasets.
